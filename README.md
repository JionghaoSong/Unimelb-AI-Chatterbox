## Project Overview

The AI Chatterbox reimagines the traditional paper-based chatterbox into a digital platform. It generates eight unique "What If" questions based on user input to foster creativity and critical thinking. The chatbot is designed to engage users in various settings, such as art galleries and educational environments, promoting in-depth exploration of complex topics.

## Features

- **Web-Based Platform**: Accessible from any device with internet access, requiring no app downloads.
- **AI-Generated Questions**: Generates eight unique "What If" questions to stimulate creativity and critical thinking.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages, making the platform accessible to a global audience.
- **No Login Required**: Allows immediate interaction without the need for account creation or login.
- **Adaptive Question Generation**: Tailors questions based on user input, offering a diverse range of speculative scenarios.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collects and securely stores user interactions for research and system improvement.
- **QR Code Access**: Facilitates easy access, especially in public settings, through QR codes.
- **Output Filtering**: Ensures generated questions adhere to safety and appropriateness standards.
- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Allows users to provide feedback to help refine and improve the chatbot's performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed before setting up the project:

- **Node.js**: Essential for running both frontend and backend servers.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Comes with Node.js and is used to manage project dependencies.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Git**: For version control and managing the codebase.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the project repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feit-comp90082/SA-RedBack.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd SA-RedBack
   ```

3. **Install dependencies using npm:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories, and configure the necessary environment variables such as MongoDB connection string and API keys.

   Example `.env` for the backend:

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-connection-string
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

5. **Start MongoDB locally or connect to MongoDB Atlas:**

   - If running MongoDB locally:

     ```bash
     mongod
     ```

   - Alternatively, connect to MongoDB Atlas using the appropriate connection string in the `.env` file.

6. **Start the servers:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   - This will launch the React frontend on port `5173` and the backend on port `3001`.

7. **Access the application:**

   - Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.

8. **Testing:**

   Set up the testing environment:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-jest
   ```

   - To run tests, navigate to the `backend` directory and execute:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
