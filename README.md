## Project Overview

The AI Chatterbox transforms the traditional paper-based chatterbox into a digital platform. It generates and explores hypothetical questions to foster creativity and critical thinking. By providing users with eight unique "what if" questions based on their input, the chatbot promotes in-depth exploration of complex topics and enhances user engagement in various settings, such as art galleries and educational environments.

## Features

- **Web-Based Platform**: Accessible via a web interface, eliminating the need for app downloads. Users can engage with the AI Chatterbox from any device with internet access.
  
- **AI-Generated Questions**: The chatbot generates eight unique "what if" questions based on user input. These questions are designed to stimulate creativity and critical thinking on a wide range of topics.

- **Multilingual Support**: The platform supports multiple languages, making it accessible to a global audience. This feature ensures that users from different linguistic backgrounds can interact with the chatbot effectively.

- **No Login Required**: Users can start interacting with the chatbot immediately without the need to create an account or log in, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience.

- **Adaptive Question Generation**: The system adapts its question generation based on user input, allowing for a diverse range of speculative questions tailored to various topics.

- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collects and securely stores user interactions for future research and analysis. This feature helps in understanding user behavior and improving the system based on feedback.

- **QR Code Access**: Simplifies user access by providing QR codes that link directly to the chatbot. This feature ensures easy and quick interaction, especially in public or gallery settings.

- **Output Filtering**: Ensures that generated questions adhere to safety and appropriateness standards by filtering out any potentially harmful or inappropriate content.

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Provides options for users to give feedback on the questions and their experience, helping to refine and improve the chatbot's performance and content.
